        Kronos makes it really easy to schedule tasks with cron.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install django-kronos
        
        ... and add ``kronos`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Define tasks
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Kronos collects tasks from ``cron`` modules in your project root and each of your applications::
        
            # app/cron.py
        
            import kronos
        
            @kronos.register('0 0 * * *')
            def complain():
                complaints = [
                    "I forgot to migrate our applications's cron jobs to our new server! Darn!",
                    "I'm out of complaints! Damnit!"
                ]
        
                print random.choice(complaints)
        
        Run tasks manually
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py runtask complain
            I forgot to migrate our applications's cron jobs to our new server! Darn!
        
        Register tasks with cron
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py installtasks
            Installed 1 task.
        
        You can review the crontab with a ``crontab -l`` command::
        
            $ crontab -l
            0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/manage.py runtask complain --settings=myprpoject.settings
        
        Usually this line will work pretty well for you, but there can be some rare
        cases when it requires modification. You can achieve it with a number of
        settings variables used by kronos:
        
        KRONOS_PYTHON
            Python interpreter to build a crontab line (defaults to the interpreter you used to
            invoke the management command).
        
        KRONOS_MANAGE
            Management command to build a crontab line (defaults to ``manage.py`` in the current
            working directory).
        
        KRONOS_PYTHONPATH
            Extra path which will be added as a ``--pythonpath`` option to the management command.
        
        KRONOS_POSTFIX
            Extra string added at the end of the command. For dirty thinks like '> /dev/null 2>&1'
        
        Define these variables in your ``settings.py`` file if you wish to alter crontab lines.
